This file is a placeholder to ensure the images directory exists.

In a production environment, you would place the following images here:
- fitness-hero.jpg
- protein.jpg
- hydration.jpg
- carbs.jpg
- workout-meal.jpg
- meal-prep.jpg
- user1.jpg
- user2.jpg
- user3.jpg

For local development, you can use any placeholder images or download appropriate
fitness-related images and rename them according to the file names used in the code.
